   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.
The purpose of this project is to calculate the average of the squares of a list of numbers, with optional weights.

The main module `squares.py` contains the core functionality, where it includes a function `average_of_squares` that takes a list of numbers and an optional list of weights, 
computes the squares of the numbers, applies the weights if provided, and returns the average.
